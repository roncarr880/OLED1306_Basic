# OLED1306_Basic
This is the Nokia library by Rinky Dink Electronics modified for an I2C 128x64 OLED.  As it doesn't use a framebuffer, it will be useful for processors with low ram memory like the UNO and NANO.  It uses some external I2C functions that can be found in some of my other projects here on GITHUB.  ( ssb6final ).
